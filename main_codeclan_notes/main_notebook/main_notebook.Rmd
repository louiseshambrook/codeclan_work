## 1.1 Summary / data exploration

`nrow()` - returns the number of rows

`ncol()` - returns the number of columns

`dim()` - returns dimensions (rows and columns)

`names()` - returns the names of all variables / columns

`class()` - returns the type of an object

`head()` - returns the top 5 rows of a df (will accept a numerical arg (, 5))

`tail()` - returns the bottom 5 rows of a df

`glimpse()` - gives a brief overview

`view()` - view entire df

`str()` - returns structure of df

`sum(is.na)` - checking for na

length


## 1.2 dplyr functions 

`select()` - selecting variables; can be used with a negative (-x)

`filter()` - filter columns out

`arrange()` - aranges rows

`arrange(desc())` - arranges in descending order

`mutate()` - overwrites / creates a new column - mutate(new_column = old_column + 5)

`group_by()` - creates a group

`summarise()` - creates a summary

can be used with:
`sum()` - summary(x, sum(y))
`count()` - 
`mean()` - 
`n()` - 
`everything()` 

group by and summarise

data <- group_by(column_x, column_y)
summarise(data, column_y = n())

`is.na()` - checks a column for NA values

Useful to use with:
`filter(!is.na(column))` - removes na values from column

`na.drop` - drops NA rows

`pull()` - 

`coalesce()` - 

across() - 

ungroup() - 
tibble() - 
n() - 
na.rm = TRUE; mutate(new_col = old_col = x(na.rm = TRUE)
summarise(count = sum(is.na(col)))



## 1.3 Other important functions

`slice_min()`

`slice_max()`

`across()` 
useful with:
~sum(is.na(.))

`ifelse()` - 
e.g mutate(gender = if_else(gender == "M", "Male", "Female"))
can have a .default

can recode from NA to NA_character
e.g. mutate(compl = recode (compl, "T" = "True", "F" = "False", .default = NA_character_))


as.numeric(name)
as.logical)
as.factor()

## 1.4 Str functions

`str_length()`

`str_extract()`

`str_extract_all()`

`str_detect()`


## 1.5 Joining functions

basic syntax - <type of join>_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x,", ".y"))
```{r}
inner_join(customers, orders, by = "customer_ID")
```

`inner_join()` - only returns records where there's an equivalent in both halves

`left_join()` - all variables from the left df will be included

`right_join()` - opposite of left_join

`full_join()` - includes everything, matching where possible

`semi_join()` - filtering join

`anti_join()` - filtering join

`bind_rows()` - appends rows, e.g. for an updated dataset

`bind_cols()` - appends columns, e.g. for an updated dataset

## 1.5.1 Pivot functions

`pivot_longer()` - takes names_to and values_to

`pivot_wider()` -  takes names_from and values_from

## 1.6 Base R functions

`if_else()`

`sample()`

`all()`

`any()`

`conflicts()`


## 1.6.1 Useful mathematical operators

`%% ` - modulo operator, e.g. 50 %% == 0

`%in%` - checks for if x is in y


## 1.6.2 Conditional operators

`==` - equal to

`!=` - not equal to

`<` - less than

`>` - greater than

`>=` - greater than OR equal to

`%in%` - is in the set


## 1.6.3 Vectorisation of R

The apply family (apply(), lapply(), sapply()) of functions allow you to take a functions and apply it in a vectorised way.

apply() - will try to return the simplest data structure it can (vectors)

lapply() - will usually return a list



## 1.7 Unit testing

Unit testing is creating code to test code that has previously been written.

Tests are generally a good idea for bigger, more advanced functions which are prone to throw more errors.

To unit test in R, apply package testthat.

`expect_equal()` - tests for if values are equal

`expect_error()` - tests for if an error is expect, and will return true if it IS expected.


## 2.1 If statements

Basic syntax
```{r}
if (condition) {
}
```

`if(){}` - if statement (code runs if condition is met)

`if(){if(){}}` - nested if statement

`if(){}else{}` - if else statement

Example
```{r}
if (4 < 5) {
  print("yes it's less")
} else {
  print("no it's not")
}
```

`if(){}else if{}` - else if statement

Example
```{r}
if (x > y) {
  print("yes it's less")
} else if (x < y){
  print("y is greater")
} else {
  print("they're the same")
}
```


## 2.2 For statements

Basic syntax
```{r}
for (num in numbers) {
}
```

`for(){}` - for statement. The () take two statements, a placeholder and an index
`for(){for(){}}` - nested for loop

Example of indexing
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(weekdays)) {
  print(i)
  print("the day is", weekdays[i], sep = " ")
}
```

It is often important to add a counter, e.g.
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(my_vector)) {
  temp_vector[i] <- my_vector[i] + 1
}
```


## 2.3 Which statements
###To be edited ALOT



```{r}
# while loops

while (snowing) {
  clear_drive()
}
```

```{r}
#R example

# set beginning value, and stop value

current_value <- 1
stop_value <- 10

while (current_value < stop_value){
  print(current_value)
  current_val <- current_val + 1
}

```



## 2.4 Functions

```{r}
#functions

#to see code of the functions, run without brackets

library

nchar()

# there are many arguments that can be passed in, but we often skip many of them
# by being explicit, you can move the arguments around, syntax doesn't matter
# what is more common, is passing arguments by place, but when one is skipped, R throws errors



```

```{r}
my_fun <- function(x, y, z) {
      1+1
}

# good practice to not return on the last line
```

```{r}
multiply_by_5 <- function(x) {
  x * 5
}

multiply_by_5(5)
```
```{r}
multiply_by <- function(x, y) {
  x * y
}

multiply_by(1:3, 10)
```

```{r}
beaver1
```


```{r}
make_price <- function(x) {
  paste("Â£", x)
}
make_price(4)

# paste0 is what you need to remove the space

# round() rounds to two decimal places

```

```{r}
triangle_function <- function(x) {
  (x*(x+1))/2
}

triangle_function(5)
```

```{r}
#global assignment operator


```
```{r}
# to debug functions

#debug() is an option
# but not great because you have to stop it
#undebug()
#debugonce() is better - goes through the code line by line



```




## 3.1 Styling and Best Practice
###To be edited ALOT

Snakecase is best practice
Objects should be nouns and functions should be verbs
Cannot use numbers in objects in the first character, e.g. 1_file
Always start with library calls

Spacing and assignment
Put spaces after commas, and after operations
No space after the start/end of brackets (e.g. (function, bleep) )
No space after calling a function, e.g mean(bleep)
Space before and after assignment operators ( <- )

Line length
Code should not be more than 80 char per line
Code can be split across multiple lines
Should have function name and opening bracket on one line
Args on the next line

Quotation marks
Double and single quotation marks are equally valid as a string
Some strings may have an apostrophe, and then the string breaks
Convention is therefore to use double quotation marks

Comments
Comments are powerful and important in understanding code
Comment above the code


## 3.2 Reproducibility and file paths
###To be edited ALOT

How to Achieve reproducibility

key to be organised, and keep a good folder structure

exam_results[, 1] - This is NOT reproducible 
a more robust/reproducible way is by naming the data, i.e. the column 
exam_results[, "student"]


organising your code so that it is easy to read - one way of doing this
is by creating functions, or modulising it


source function - looks in the working directory for various files
source()
grabs the functon from e.g. an R script, and places in the global env, so it can be run

e.g. 
source("01_multiply_function.R") # this would be a separate script
source("02_add_function.R") # this would be a separate script
a <- multiply_by_n(2, 4)
b <- add_two(a)
b


in an R script, you can add headers / tails
shift + cmd + r
on r script, you can select the little lines menu on top right which automatically indexes



documentation

main points (comments)
purpose and objective - WHY
instruct how to follow the code

key things to note and include:
date (e.g. if packages or similar are or become out of date)
sources
evidence
decision making process
assume the reader has no prior knowledge

restart and run all chunks, is safest way to avoid creating objects etc outside
of the active / required environment/notebook
if you do want to do this, sourcing is a good way to do this
if scripts are very long / take long to run, you can save scripts to a specfic workspace
saveRDS(object, file = "name")
but comment it out after saving it the first time



relative file path

difference between relative file path and absolute file path
relative file path is relative to your working directory, i.e. you do not need
to input the entire filepath


read_csv("/Users/louiseshambrook/GitHub/codeclan_work/codeclan_work/week_02/day_4/w2_d4_reproducability/no_project_example/")
trying to read in data, but unable to locate it / your files have not been set up correctly
by using ~, it brings you to the top of your directory
This is NOT reproducible, as their file structure may differ (and likely will)

if the data file is not accessible on the same level (e.g. if the data is not
contained within the same folder as the rproj, then the library(data) with the 
function data can correct this)
e.g. read_csv(here("data/students")



## 3.3 Assertive programming

## 4.1 Tidy data
###To be edited ALOT

```{r}
# What is tidy data?

# Tidy data has structure
# 1. Every variable has its own column
# 2. Each observation has its own row
# 3. Each value must have its own cell (e.g. not Joe Bloggs, 28)

# Tidy data has relationships (e.g. relationship between name and bank account number)

```

```{r}
# Some terminology

# Long format - every row represents an observation belonging to a particular category
# Wide format - observations are spread across multiple columns

```

```{r}
# tidyr package

# pivot_longer() - gathers columns into rows
# pivot_wider() - spreads rows into columns
# seperate() - seperates one column into two
# unite() - unites several into one

```

```{r}
# create subject info tibble
subject_hr <- tibble( name = c("SUBJ01","SUBJ02","SUBJ03"), 
                      hr_am = c(68,72,68), 
                      hr_pm = c(58,89,52))
subject_hr


```

```{r}
subject_hr %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("hr_am", "hr_pm"),
               names_to = "measurement_time",
