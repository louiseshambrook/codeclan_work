**Duration: 30 minutes** 

Now it's your turn to practice the verbs on a new dataset. Complete the following task:

# MVP

**Task 1.**  
Load in the `country_data.csv` file and take a look at it. What needs changed in this to make it tidy? Which columns need made into long format, and which need spread to rows?

<br>

**Task 2.**  
Do the appropriate pivoting of your columns using R  

<br>

**Task 3.**  
Separate the `country` variable so you have the name in one column and the number in another.   

<br>

**Task 4.**  
Unite the `code_letter` and `code_numb` variables so that they are both in one column, with no spaces separating them.
