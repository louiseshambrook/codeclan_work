Week 10 - day 1

Correlations

positive correlation - y increases, as x increases

Negative correlation - y decreases as x increases

Strong/weak correlation - measured by correlation coeffecient ( -1 / +1)
When r = 1, then there is a linear correlation (?)

cor()

Task

Change the noise and gradient values 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

noisy_bivariate <- function(noise = 1, gradient = 1){
  x <- runif(n = 200, min = 0, max = 10)
  y <- gradient * x + 10
  y_scatter <- noise * 4 * rnorm(n = 200)
  y <- y + y_scatter
  data = tibble(x, y)

  r <- round(cor(x, y), 4)
  title <- paste(
    "noise = ", noise,
    ", gradient = ", gradient,
    ", r = ", r
  )
  
  data %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    ylim(min(c(min(y), 0)), max(c(max(y), 10))) +
    ggtitle(title)
  
}
noisy_bivariate(noise = 0.5, gradient = 0)
```

Strength of correlation

As written out by one author (JD Evans)

0 - none
0.01 - 0.19 - very weak
0.2 - 0.39 - weak
0.4 - 0.59 - moderate
0.6 - 0.79 - strong
