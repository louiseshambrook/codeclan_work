National Waiting Times Centre,"SMR01 completeness for the National Waiting Times Centre (NWTC) for quarter ending June 2021 was 99%.

Increases were seen in all inpatient and day case activity when comparing April to June 2021 to the same quarter last year. This is most likely due to the return of services, following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. However, it should be noted that any changes are based on relatively small numbers which will impact on the percentage change.

During the pandemic, the Golden Jubilee have been broadening their scope of the work and have been receiving a lot of new activity from other NHS Boards, much of it relating to cancer patients, and also from different specialties such as: Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT); Gynaecology; Urology; and Women and Newborn and Dental Groupings.

The Golden Jubilee National Hospital have previously advised that they significantly reduced non-urgent activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in temporary ward changes and service reconfigurations, which in turn led to less orthopaedic and general inpatient beds, but significantly more temporary available cardiology inpatient beds. Golden Jubilee National Hospital continues to provide urgent surgical cancer services with surgical cancer patients bedded in various specialities.

Prior to the pandemic, NHS Ayrshire and Arran previously advised that they had closed a number of beds in Ailsa, University Hospital Ayr, University Hospital Crosshouse, and East Community Ayrshire, which accounted for some of the historic reduction of available staff bed days. Health and Social Care Partnerships and Acute Services put in place a number of measures to sustain keeping these beds closed."

Large increases have been observed for Geriatric Medicine from April 2019 onwards. NHS Borders have advised that the significant changes being seen in Geriatric Medicine are due to changes in the pathways / model of care for patients such as additional wards, reduction in average length of stays, and the doubling bed complement. This has meant that more patients have been transferred to and discharged from Geriatric Medicine. NHS Borders also had an Older Peoples Assessment Unit a pilot running in February and March 2020 with 14 additional beds. In addition, this increased activity could be potentially inflated due to staff not ticking the 'not on medical grounds' box when they transfer care within Trakcare.","SMR00 completeness for NHS Borders (new attendances only) for the quarter ending June 2021 was 100%.

In addition, NHS Borders have previously said that they had closed a number of beds over the course of 2018/19 as they progressed work to prevent admissions and care for people at home in line with their transformation programme. NHS Borders also advised that they have managed to reduce the length of stay in acute hospital admissions and occupied bed days have gone down, so occupancy has reduced.

In February and March 2020, NHS Borders set up a new pathway for geriatric medicine and this increased general acute beds. In response to COVID-19, the bed compliments changed in general acute wards and general medical wards."

Data Management have advised that since NHS Forth Valley's move onto TrakCare, there has been an increase in the number of SMR01 records submitted. Data Management are currently investigating this issue and have informed that this is down to how the system is used. When a patient is moving consultant a box can be ticked for not on medical grounds, if this is not ticked an additional SMR is generated. 

In addition, Combined Assessment Unit (CAU) activity previously recorded in SMR00 is now being recorded in SMR01 and is increasing the numbers of emergency admission SMR01 records submitted.","SMR00 completeness (new attendances only) for NHS Forth Valley for quarter ending June 2021 was 97%.

Data Management identified SMR00 data, submitted by the Board, for Forth Valley patients being treated at the National Waiting Times Centre. There were around 400 records affected which Data Management asked the Board to remove as the activity had been submitted on SMR01 by the National Waiting Times Centre NWTC.

NHS Highland have experienced ongoing reporting issues due to the way in which some outpatient clinics are configured in TrakCare.  In many cases these issues have the potential to impact on both SMR00 and ISD(S)1 Outpatients reporting, impacting on the National figures published. Although work is ongoing to address these issues, system restrictions within TrakCare means there is no functionality available to correct Adhoc Clinic templates nor make retrospective revisions to SMR00 or ISD(S)1 for attendances linked to Adhoc Clinics.  The ISD(S)1 Card Class 4 activity used in the analysis of return outpatients is essentially based on a snapshot of NHS Highland's position as at the end of each quarter.  It should be noted NHS Highland is not in a position to submit revisions to the snapshot until such time as the clinic configuration issues mentioned above are completely resolved.

As part of a local cost improvement project back in January 2019, it was discovered that Dermatology patients seen at Raigmore Hospital's Dermatology Treatment Centre were not being captured in TrakCare. The issue has since been addressed and the activity has been reported from April 2019 onwards. As highlighted above, NHS Highland is unable to retrospectively report any data prior to April 2019.","Increases were seen in the number of average available staffed beds and percentage occupancy when comparing April to June 2021 to the same quarter last year.

Due to ongoing system limitations the bed data submitted from the quarter ending December 2015 up to June 2019 is subject to quality and completeness issues, therefore caution should be taken when interpreting the figures published. A solution was introduced in June 2019 which has significantly improved the situation, however, NHS Highland continue to experience ongoing data quality issues affecting the available bed figures due to the management of bed restrictions and contingency beds.

NHS Tayside have previously commented that there has been a change in the way clinics have been set up in TrakCare. The board have added Nurse led clinics not previously setup to submit SMR00s. In addition, NHS Tayside have also set up clinics for telephone consultations since March 2020 for both consultant and nurse-led activity.

Many trends observed will be influenced by and attributable to the data completeness levels, small numbers, and the impact of COVID-19 highlighted above. Therefore, caution should be taken when comparing quarterly information.

From 2020 onwards, there has been a marked increase in the use of the XSU (Unspecified) specialty across many of the NHS Boards. This is most likely due to their COVID response and not allocating beds to specific specialties.

Records have been identified with potentially duplicate information coming from more than one NHS Board for the same location. The numbers concerned are very low and the impact is not significant. Additionally, there are issues with the allocation of NHS hospitals to NHS Boards and private hospital activity to the 'non-NHS Provider code'. Data Management have investigated and found that in many of these cases, this can be attributed to visiting consultant activity and NHS Boards sending their patients to private locations."
Unknown Health Board,,"Unknown Health Board' refers to locations or residences that cannot be attributed to any of the other NHS Boards. Sharp increases have been observed in this category from April 2020 onwards. For example, new outpatient unknowns increased ten-fold when comparing January to March 2020 to April to June 2020. The main reason for these increases are records submitted with unknown location code (D299N: Location not otherwise coded). This results in the Health Board of treatment not being derived and the activity is not allocated to the actual NHS Board but instead categorised against 'Unknown Health Board'.

Increased use of the unknown location code can be attributed to uncertainty in the provision of outpatient clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinics are set up as a mixture of face to face, telephone, video link and Near Me appointments. However, this code has been used as a 'work around' during the pandemic, as location of activity was not known. This made the setting up of clinics simpler in Trakcare. The unknown location code has been used by several boards; predominantly by NHS Tayside and Borders, although use of the code is decreasing in 2021. New outpatient unknowns have decreased by over a quarter (27%) comparing April to June 2021 to the same quarter last year.

Data Management are looking at identifying codes that Boards could use so that the Health Board of treatment can be derived correctly, and the intention is that records already submitted using this code will be recoded.",
