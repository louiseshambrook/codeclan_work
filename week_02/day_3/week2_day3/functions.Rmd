```{r}
#functions

#to see code of the functions, run without brackets

library

nchar()

# there are many arguments that can be passed in, but we often skip many of them
# by being explicit, you can move the arguments around, syntax doesn't matter
# what is more common, is passing arguments by place, but when one is skipped, R throws errors



```

```{r}
my_fun <- function(x, y, z) {
      1+1
}

# good practice to not return on the last line
```

```{r}
multiply_by_5 <- function(x) {
  x * 5

# paste0 is what you need to remove the space

# round() rounds to two decimal places

# to debug functions

#debug() is an option
# but not great because you have to stop it
#undebug()
#debugonce() is better - goes through the code line by line
