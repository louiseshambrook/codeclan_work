```{r}
# relative file path

# difference between relative file path and absolute file path

# relative file path is relative to your working directory, i.e. you do not need
# to input the entire filepath
```

```{r}
#absolute file path

library(tidyverse)
read_csv("/Users/louiseshambrook/GitHub/codeclan_work/codeclan_work/week_02/day_4/w2_d4_reproducability/no_project_example/")
# trying to read in data, but unable to locate it / your files have not been set up correctly
# 
# by using ~, it brings you to the top of your directory

# This is NOT reproducible, as their file structure may differ (and likely will)
```

```{r}
read_csv("no_project_example/data/students.csv")
```


```{r}
# if the data file is not accessible on the same level (e.g. if the data is not
# contained within the same folder as the rproj, then the library(data) with the 
#function data can correct this)
# e.g. read_csv(here("data/students")
```
